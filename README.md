Selection of variables is a common problem in many areas, and particularly in bioin-
formatics. Identified genes or sequences can be used to classify future observations,
influencing the treatment of patients. Selection of significant genes via expression
patterns is an important problem in microarray experiments, which are notorious for
generating a very large number of predictors compared to the number of observations.
Microarray or high throughput sequencing experiments are expensive, and data sets
have often only a few hundreds of specimens. Owing to small sample size and the
large number of variables(genes), the selection process can be unstable. This project
proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model for gene (variable) selection. I employ latent
variables to specialize the model to a regression setting and uses a g prior to perform
the variable selection.
